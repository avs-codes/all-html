        <h1>At long last...</h1>

        <p>It seems you have reached your goal.</p>

        <p>But something does not seem quite right. A unsatisfied feeling of sorts.</p>

        <p>Where's the huzzah and celebration? Is this not our true destination?</p>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>

        <p>How could we be so blind! The image still prevails. We have lost sight of our fundamentals.</p>

        <p>We must mangle its source to truly destroy the veil.</p>

        <p>Maybe then it will decide to show its true colors.</p>
