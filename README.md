Core 1 Interaction All HTML Project by Alex Vinicius Silva

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE: This repo is a playable puzzle/adventure game made only with HTML.

It functions significantly better if you DOWNLOAD THE REPO as a zip to your computer and play on that. (Don't forget to unzip it)

It is also HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT BROWSE through the repo as it WILL SPOIL THE GAME!

If you wish, feel free to browse through the repo AFTER FINISHING THE GAME or if you are really stuck.

Besides that, I really hope you enjoy the puzzle!
