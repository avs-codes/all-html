Core 1 Interaction All HTML Project by Alex Vinicius Silva

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE: This repo is a playable puzzle/adventure game made only with HTML.

It functions significantly better if you DOWNLOAD THE REPO as a zip to your computer and play from that. (Don't forget to unzip it!)

It is also HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT BROWSE THROUGH THE REPO ON GITHUB as it WILL SPOIL THE GAME!

If you wish, feel free to browse through the repo AFTER FINISHING THE GAME or if you are really stuck.

Oh and outside of the game, don't worry about any of the "placeholder.txt" files. They don't have any content and were just necessary
to make as a result of how GitHub manages repos. So you can fully ignore them without any problems in the game. 

Besides that, I really hope you enjoy the puzzle!
